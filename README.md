The divine bottom CLI exists to alleviate this pain. No longer will you struggle when communicating with the average Discord user.

## Usage
Clone the repo, run ``cargo build``, and then use the CLI.

Bottom translator 0.1.0
Kaylynn <mkaylynn7@gmail.com>
Fantastic (maybe) CLI for translating between bottom and human-readable text

USAGE:
    bottom [OPTIONS] <--bottomify|--regress> [text]...

FLAGS:
    -b, --bottomify    Translate text to bottom
    -h, --help         Prints help information
    -r, --regress      Translate bottom to human-readable text (futile)
    -V, --version      Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -i, --input <INPUT>      Input file [Default: stdin]
    -o, --output <OUTPUT>    Output file [Default: stdout]

ARGS:
    <text>...
```
(Any similarity to ``--help`` output is entirely accidental)

## FAQ

### Why?
I had a moment of enlightenment, and the truth came to me in an instant.
At that moment, I knew what had to be done.

### But seriously, why?
Why not?

### Isn't using a CLI for this a really bad idea? 
Yes.

### Aren't terminals notorious for being bad at displaying Unicode?
I don't care.

### Isn't this encoding method extremely inefficient?
Yes.

### <something about code quality\>
Documentation is for losers.

### Rust btw
It's not long until my hippocampus becomes ferrous. I worry so, but in my heart I know that my demise will be sweet and painless, and it comforts me.
